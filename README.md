Learning Pathway

The following roadmap outlines a progressive approach to mastering KDB+/q. Each phase includes objectives, resources, and tasks to ensure steady skill development.

Phase 1: Fundamentals of KDB+/q (Weeks 1–2)

Objective: Gain proficiency in q syntax, data types, and basic query operations.
Resources:





Q for Mortals, Chapters 1–3: Covers syntax, lists, and tables.



Kx Academy: Introduction to q: Free tutorials on core query techniques. Tasks:



Install the free version of KDB+ from kx.com.



Practice fundamental queries (select, update, where).



Develop a basic q script to create and query a table, saved as scripts/basics.q. Notes: Document insights on key concepts, such as dictionaries versus tables.

Phase 2: Advanced Table Operations and Joins (Weeks 3–4)

Objective: Master complex queries involving joins and aggregations.
Resources:





Kx Reference: Joins: Comprehensive guide to aj, lj, and wj.



Q for Mortals, Chapter 4: In-depth exploration of table operations. Tasks:



Create a table using sample trade data from data/trades.csv.



Write queries for inner joins, left joins, and aggregations (e.g., total volume by date).



Save scripts as scripts/joins.q. Notes: Record challenges and solutions, particularly with asof joins.

Phase 3: Time-Series Analysis (Weeks 5–6)

Objective: Analyze time-series data, such as stock prices and tick data.
Resources:





Kx Cookbook: Time-Series: Practical examples of time-series queries.



Kx Whitepapers: Insights into time-series analytics. Tasks:



Import a dataset from data/stock_prices.csv.



Develop queries for moving averages, volatility calculations, and time-based aggregations.



Save scripts as scripts/timeseries.q. Notes: Note optimization techniques, such as the use of indexed tables.

Phase 4: Project – Trade Data Processor (Weeks 7–8)

Objective: Build a KDB+ application for processing high-frequency trade data.
Resources:





Kx Reference: Performance: Techniques for query optimization. Tasks:



Develop a script to ingest and process trade data, saved as scripts/trade_processor.q.



Implement efficient joins and aggregations for real-time analytics.



Document the project in docs/trade_processor.md. Notes: Highlight advanced techniques, such as WebSocket integration for streaming data.

Phase 5: Advanced Topics and Integration (Weeks 9–12)

Objective: Explore real-time analytics and integration with Python.
Resources:





PyKX Documentation: Guide to KDB+ and Python interoperability.



Kx Whitepapers: Tick Data: Real-time processing strategies. Tasks:



Integrate KDB+ with Python using PyKX for data visualization.



Develop a real-time dashboard or portfolio optimizer.



Save scripts as scripts/advanced.q. Notes: Document experiences with tools like PyKX and matplotlib integration.

Projects





Time-Series Analytics Dashboard: Processes stock price data to compute moving averages and volatility metrics (scripts/timeseries.q).



Trade Data Processor: Handles high-frequency trade data with optimized joins (scripts/trade_processor.q).
